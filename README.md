# Business Growth & Revenue Health Monitoring Dashboard


This dashboard analyzes weekly revenue performance for a Telco company through user base dynamics, breaking growth and decline into retention, acquisition, reactivation, and leakage.
It highlights not only what changed, but why it changed, and surfaces near-term revenue exposure driven by user inactivity, to support data-driven growth and retention decisions.
